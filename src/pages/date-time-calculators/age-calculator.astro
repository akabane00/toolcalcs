    <h2>How to Calculate Your Exact Age</h2>
    <p>Calculating your exact age sounds simple at first glance, but the math is more nuanced than subtracting one year from another. Because months have different numbers of days and leap years add an extra day to February, a precise age calculation requires careful date arithmetic.</p>
    <p>The basic method works as follows. Start with the current date (or any target date) and subtract the birth date. Compare the day values first: if the current day is less than the birth day, you need to borrow days from the previous month, reducing the month count by one and adding the number of days in that preceding month. Next, compare the months: if the adjusted current month is less than the birth month, borrow 12 months from the year count and reduce the year difference by one. The final result gives you the exact number of full years, remaining months, and remaining days.</p>
    <p>For example, if someone was born on March 25, 1990, and today is February 10, 2026, the calculation proceeds like this. The day value (10) is less than the birth day (25), so we borrow from January, adding 31 days to get 41, then subtract 25 to get 16 days. The month count drops from 2 to 1, which is still less than the birth month (3), so we borrow 12 months, making it 13, and subtract 3 to get 10 months. The year count drops from 2026 to 2025, and 2025 minus 1990 equals 35 years. The exact age is 35 years, 10 months, and 16 days.</p>
    <p>This borrowing method mirrors how manual subtraction works with larger numbers and is the same approach used by most age calculation software, including this calculator.</p>

    <h2>Age in Different Units</h2>
    <p>Your age can be expressed in many units beyond years, months, and days. Each unit offers a different perspective on the passage of time.</p>
    <p><strong>Years</strong> are the most common way to express age. When someone asks how old you are, you typically respond in years. However, years are imprecise: a year can be 365 or 366 days, and the number of days in each month varies.</p>
    <p><strong>Months</strong> provide a finer measure. A 30-year-old has lived approximately 360 months. Pediatricians often track infant development in months because growth changes so rapidly in the first years of life. Parents commonly say their child is "18 months old" rather than "one and a half years old."</p>
    <p><strong>Weeks</strong> are used extensively in pregnancy tracking, where a full-term pregnancy is approximately 40 weeks. A 30-year-old has lived roughly 1,565 weeks.</p>
    <p><strong>Days</strong> offer the most precise whole-number measure of age. A 30-year-old has lived approximately 10,957 days, accounting for leap years. Some people celebrate milestones like their 10,000th day alive.</p>
    <p><strong>Hours</strong> push the granularity even further. That same 30-year-old has been alive for roughly 262,968 hours. While we rarely think of age in hours, the number highlights just how much time accumulates over a lifetime.</p>

    <h2>How Age Is Calculated in Different Cultures</h2>
    <p>The Western system of counting age, where a newborn starts at zero and gains a year on each birthday, is not universal. Several cultures have developed their own systems for counting age, and the differences can be significant.</p>
    <p><strong>Korean age</strong> was one of the best-known alternatives. Under this system, a baby was considered one year old at birth because the time spent in the womb counted as the first year of life. Everyone then gained one year on January 1 of each year, regardless of their actual birthday. This meant a baby born on December 31 would turn two years old the very next day. In June 2023, South Korea officially adopted the international age system for legal and administrative purposes, though many Koreans still use the traditional system in everyday conversation.</p>
    <p><strong>Chinese age</strong> follows a similar concept. Traditionally, a child is one year old at birth and gains a year at the start of each Lunar New Year. Because the Lunar New Year date shifts annually, the exact difference between Chinese age and Western age varies from year to year. This traditional system is still used in some cultural contexts, particularly for determining auspicious dates and in traditional medicine.</p>
    <p><strong>Japanese age</strong> once used a system called <em>kazoedoshi</em>, which worked almost identically to Korean age. Japan officially switched to the Western system in 1902, though <em>kazoedoshi</em> is still referenced in some traditional and religious contexts.</p>
    <p>Understanding these differences matters in an increasingly connected world. A person described as "30 years old" in the Korean system could be 28 or 29 by international counting, which has real implications for legal documents, international contracts, and medical records.</p>

    <h2>Why Knowing Your Exact Age Matters</h2>
    <p>Knowing your precise age is not just a matter of curiosity. Many important life events, legal rights, and financial decisions are tied to specific age thresholds.</p>
    <p><strong>Legal milestones</strong> often depend on your exact age down to the day. You can get a driver's permit, vote, or buy alcohol only after reaching a specific birthday. Immigration and visa applications frequently require precise age verification. In many jurisdictions, criminal sentencing guidelines differ for minors and adults, making the exact date of birth critically important in legal proceedings.</p>
    <p><strong>Medical applications</strong> rely on accurate age data. Doctors use age to determine vaccination schedules, health screening recommendations, and drug dosages. Pediatric growth charts are age-specific, and certain medical tests have different normal ranges depending on your age. Health insurance premiums are also calculated partly based on age.</p>
    <p><strong>Financial planning</strong> hinges on age-related milestones. Retirement account contribution limits and withdrawal rules depend on your age. Social Security benefits are calculated differently based on the age you begin claiming them. Life insurance premiums increase with age, and many financial products have minimum or maximum age requirements.</p>
    <p><strong>Personal milestones</strong> also give age significance. Many people celebrate decade birthdays (30, 40, 50) with special events. Knowing you have lived exactly 10,000 days or 1,000,000 minutes can make for a memorable occasion. Some cultures celebrate specific ages with traditional ceremonies, such as the quincea&ntilde;era at 15 or the bar and bat mitzvah at 12 or 13.</p>

    <h2>Age Milestones in the United States</h2>
    <p>In the United States, many legal rights and responsibilities are tied to specific ages. Here are the most significant milestones:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Age 16:</strong> In most states, you can obtain a driver's license (some states issue learner's permits at 15 or even 14). You can also begin working with fewer restrictions under federal labor laws.</li>
      <li><strong>Age 18:</strong> You are legally an adult. You can vote in federal and state elections, sign contracts, join the military without parental consent, and serve on a jury. You can also buy tobacco products in most states (though federal law raised the age to 21 in 2019).</li>
      <li><strong>Age 21:</strong> You can legally purchase and consume alcohol. In many states, this is also the minimum age for purchasing recreational cannabis and for obtaining a concealed carry permit.</li>
      <li><strong>Age 25:</strong> Car rental rates typically drop at 25. Auto insurance premiums also tend to decrease. You are no longer eligible to be claimed as a dependent on your parents' health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.</li>
      <li><strong>Age 35:</strong> The minimum age to serve as President of the United States. Also the age at which fertility specialists often recommend additional prenatal testing.</li>
      <li><strong>Age 50:</strong> You become eligible for catch-up contributions to 401(k) and IRA retirement accounts, allowing you to save more for retirement.</li>
      <li><strong>Age 59.5:</strong> You can withdraw from retirement accounts (401(k), IRA) without the 10% early withdrawal penalty.</li>
      <li><strong>Age 62:</strong> The earliest age you can claim Social Security retirement benefits, though benefits are permanently reduced compared to waiting until full retirement age.</li>
      <li><strong>Age 65:</strong> You become eligible for Medicare. This is also the age many employers use for traditional retirement.</li>
      <li><strong>Age 67:</strong> Full retirement age for Social Security for anyone born in 1960 or later. Claiming at this age gives you your full benefit amount.</li>
      <li><strong>Age 70:</strong> Social Security benefits reach their maximum if you delay claiming until this age, providing roughly 24% more than your full retirement age benefit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Zodiac Signs by Birth Date</h2>
    <p>Western astrology assigns one of twelve zodiac signs based on your date of birth. Each sign corresponds to a roughly 30-day period during the year. While zodiac signs are a matter of belief and entertainment rather than science, many people enjoy knowing their sign and reading horoscopes.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Aries</strong> (March 21 - April 19): Known for confidence and determination.</li>
      <li><strong>Taurus</strong> (April 20 - May 20): Associated with reliability and patience.</li>
      <li><strong>Gemini</strong> (May 21 - June 20): Characterized by adaptability and curiosity.</li>
      <li><strong>Cancer</strong> (June 21 - July 22): Linked to loyalty and emotional depth.</li>
      <li><strong>Leo</strong> (July 23 - August 22): Connected to creativity and leadership.</li>
      <li><strong>Virgo</strong> (August 23 - September 22): Recognized for analytical thinking and attention to detail.</li>
      <li><strong>Libra</strong> (September 23 - October 22): Associated with fairness and diplomacy.</li>
      <li><strong>Scorpio</strong> (October 23 - November 21): Known for passion and resourcefulness.</li>
      <li><strong>Sagittarius</strong> (November 22 - December 21): Characterized by optimism and a love of freedom.</li>
      <li><strong>Capricorn</strong> (December 22 - January 19): Linked to discipline and ambition.</li>
      <li><strong>Aquarius</strong> (January 20 - February 18): Connected to independence and originality.</li>
      <li><strong>Pisces</strong> (February 19 - March 20): Recognized for empathy and intuition.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This calculator automatically determines your zodiac sign based on your date of birth, saving you the trouble of looking it up.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3>How do you calculate exact age from date of birth?</h3>
    <p>Subtract the birth date from the target date using year-month-day arithmetic. Compare the days first and borrow from the previous month if necessary. Then compare the months and borrow from the year if needed. The result gives you the precise number of full years, remaining months, and remaining days. This calculator does all of this automatically when you enter your date of birth.</p>

    <h3>Does the age calculator account for leap years?</h3>
    <p>Yes. The calculator uses JavaScript Date objects, which correctly handle leap years in all calculations. Total day counts include February 29 for each leap year in the range. If your birthday is February 29, the calculator recognizes that your birthday occurs only once every four years and calculates your next birthday accordingly.</p>

    <h3>How is age calculated differently in other cultures?</h3>
    <p>The most notable difference is the East Asian age system, historically used in Korea, China, and Japan. In this system, a person is one year old at birth and gains a year on New Year's Day rather than on their birthday. South Korea officially retired this system in 2023, switching to the international method. The traditional Chinese system ties age advancement to the Lunar New Year rather than January 1. This calculator uses the international (Western) age counting method.</p>

    <h3>What if I was born on February 29?</h3>
    <p>If you were born on February 29 (a leap day), the calculator handles this correctly. In non-leap years, your birthday effectively falls on March 1 for the purposes of counting full years. The next birthday calculation will show your actual February 29 birthday in the next leap year, along with the number of days until that date.</p>

    <h3>Can I calculate the age of someone who has passed away?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Enter the person's date of birth and change the "Calculate Age As Of" date to their date of passing. The calculator will show their exact age at that time, along with total days lived and all other statistics.</p>
