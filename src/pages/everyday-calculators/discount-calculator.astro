    <h2>How to Calculate a Discount</h2>
    <p>Calculating a discount is one of the most practical math skills you can have as a shopper. Whether you are browsing a clearance rack, comparing online deals, or evaluating a coupon offer, understanding how discounts work ensures you always know exactly how much you are saving and what you will actually pay at the register.</p>
    <p>The basic discount formula is simple: multiply the original price by the discount percentage expressed as a decimal. If a jacket originally costs $120 and the store is offering 25% off, multiply $120 by 0.25 to get a discount of $30. Subtract that from the original price to find the sale price: $120 &minus; $30 = $90.</p>
    <div class="formula-box">
      <code>Discount Amount = Original Price &times; (Discount % / 100)</code><br />
      <code>Sale Price = Original Price &minus; Discount Amount</code>
    </div>
    <p>For quick mental math, there are several useful shortcuts. To calculate 10% of any price, simply move the decimal point one place to the left. A $75 item at 10% off saves you $7.50. For 20%, double the 10% figure: $7.50 &times; 2 = $15.00. For 25%, divide the price by 4: $75 / 4 = $18.75. And for 50% off, simply halve the price: $75 / 2 = $37.50. These mental math tricks make it easy to estimate savings on the fly without reaching for your phone.</p>
    <p>When you encounter less common percentages like 15% or 35%, you can break them into easier pieces. For 15%, calculate 10% and then add half of that. For a $60 item: 10% is $6.00, half of that is $3.00, so 15% is $9.00. For 35%, find 30% (three times 10%) and add 5% (half of 10%). These building-block techniques work for any percentage and are much faster than long division.</p>

    <h2>Stacked Discounts Explained</h2>
    <p>Stacked discounts, sometimes called compound discounts or double discounts, occur when two or more percentage discounts are applied to the same item sequentially. This is common during major sales events when a store offers an additional percentage off already-reduced merchandise, or when you combine a store coupon with a sale price.</p>
    <p>The critical concept to understand is that stacked discounts are not simply added together. A 20% discount followed by an additional 15% discount does not equal 35% off the original price. Instead, the second discount is applied to the already-discounted price, resulting in a smaller total discount than you might expect.</p>
    <p>Here is how stacked discounts work step by step. Suppose a $200 pair of shoes is on sale for 30% off, and you have a coupon for an additional 10% off the sale price. First, calculate the initial discount: $200 &times; 0.30 = $60, bringing the price down to $140. Then apply the second discount to the reduced price: $140 &times; 0.10 = $14, making the final price $126. The total savings are $74, which is 37% off the original price, not 40%.</p>
    <div class="formula-box">
      <code>Price After Stacked Discounts = Original Price &times; (1 &minus; D1/100) &times; (1 &minus; D2/100)</code>
    </div>
    <p>The order in which you apply stacked discounts does not matter mathematically. Whether you apply the 30% first and then the 10%, or the 10% first and then the 30%, the final price is identical. This is because multiplication is commutative: $200 &times; 0.70 &times; 0.90 equals $200 &times; 0.90 &times; 0.70. Both give you $126.</p>
    <p>Stacked discounts are particularly common during holiday shopping seasons like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and end-of-season clearance events. Retailers use phrases like "take an extra 20% off sale prices" to create a sense of exceptional value. Understanding the math behind stacked discounts helps you evaluate whether a deal is truly as good as it sounds, or whether a competitor's single, larger discount might actually save you more money.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Sales Tax</h2>
    <p>Sales tax is a consumption tax imposed by state and local governments on the sale of goods and, in some jurisdictions, services. In the United States, sales tax rates vary widely by state, county, and city, ranging from 0% in states like Oregon, Montana, and New Hampshire to over 10% in some municipalities in states like Louisiana, Tennessee, and Arkansas.</p>
    <p>An important detail that many shoppers overlook is that sales tax is calculated on the discounted price, not the original price. If you purchase a $150 item that is marked down to $100, you pay sales tax on the $100 sale price. This means discounts effectively reduce your tax burden as well, compounding your savings. In a state with an 8% sales tax, you save not only the $50 discount but also an additional $4.00 in tax ($50 &times; 0.08), for a true savings of $54.</p>
    <p>When budgeting for a purchase, always factor in sales tax to avoid surprises at the checkout counter. Many online shoppers are accustomed to seeing the pre-tax price during browsing, only to encounter a higher total at checkout when tax is applied. Our calculator includes a sales tax field so you can see the exact final price you will pay, including all applicable taxes, before making your purchase decision.</p>
    <p>Some items may be exempt from sales tax depending on your state. Groceries, prescription medications, and clothing are tax-exempt in several states. During back-to-school sales tax holidays, certain categories of items may be temporarily exempt from sales tax. These exemptions vary by state and often have price thresholds, so check your state's department of revenue for specific rules.</p>

    <h2>Common Discount Types</h2>
    <p>Understanding the different types of discounts retailers use can help you become a more strategic and informed shopper. Each type has its own mechanics, benefits, and potential pitfalls.</p>
    <p><strong>Percentage-off discounts</strong> are the most straightforward and widely used. A flat percentage is taken off the original or listed price. These are easy to calculate and compare across different items and stores. Examples include "25% off all outerwear" or "save 40% on select electronics." The higher the original price, the more you save in absolute dollar terms.</p>
    <p><strong>Dollar-amount discounts</strong> take a fixed amount off regardless of the item's price. A "$10 off your purchase of $50 or more" coupon is a common example. These discounts are most valuable on lower-priced items. A $10 discount on a $50 purchase is effectively 20% off, but the same $10 off a $200 purchase is only 5%. Always convert dollar discounts to percentages mentally to assess their true value.</p>
    <p><strong>Buy-one-get-one (BOGO) deals</strong> offer a free or discounted item when you purchase another at full price. A true "buy one, get one free" deal is effectively 50% off when you consider the cost per item. Variations like "buy one, get one 50% off" are less generous, amounting to a 25% discount per item. BOGO deals are most worthwhile when you genuinely need or will use both items.</p>
    <p><strong>Bulk or quantity discounts</strong> reward you for purchasing larger quantities. These are common in wholesale stores, office supply retailers, and e-commerce platforms. For example, "buy 3, get 15% off" or tiered pricing that decreases the per-unit cost as you buy more. Bulk discounts make financial sense only if you will use the additional items before they expire or become obsolete.</p>
    <p><strong>Loyalty and membership discounts</strong> are reserved for members of a store's rewards program or paid membership club. These can include exclusive sale access, additional percentage-off coupons, cashback rewards, or tiered benefits that increase with your spending level. Warehouse clubs like Costco and Sam's Club charge annual membership fees in exchange for consistently lower prices.</p>
    <p><strong>Seasonal and clearance discounts</strong> occur when retailers need to move inventory to make room for new merchandise. End-of-season clearance sales can offer the deepest discounts, often 50% to 75% off or more. The tradeoff is limited selection in terms of sizes, colors, and styles. Savvy shoppers plan ahead and buy next season's items during clearance.</p>

    <h2>Shopping Tips to Maximize Savings</h2>
    <p>Knowing how to calculate a discount is just the first step. The most effective way to save money while shopping is to combine multiple strategies and approaches. Here are proven tips to help you get the most value from every purchase.</p>
    <p><strong>Compare the effective discount, not the sticker price.</strong> Two stores might sell the same product at different prices with different discounts. Store A sells a laptop for $1,000 at 15% off ($850 final price), while Store B sells it for $950 at 8% off ($874 final price). Even though Store A's original price is higher, its discount makes it the better deal. Always calculate the final price before deciding where to buy.</p>
    <p><strong>Stack coupons and promo codes wisely.</strong> Many retailers allow you to combine a store coupon with a manufacturer's coupon, or use a promo code on top of a sale price. Check coupon aggregator websites, browser extensions, and the retailer's own app for available codes before completing any online purchase. Even a small additional 5% or 10% off can add up significantly over time.</p>
    <p><strong>Time your purchases strategically.</strong> Prices for many product categories follow predictable seasonal patterns. Electronics are cheapest during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Winter clothing goes on deep clearance in January and February. Mattresses are discounted during Presidents' Day and Memorial Day weekends. Knowing these patterns lets you plan major purchases for when prices are naturally at their lowest.</p>
    <p><strong>Use cashback credit cards and apps.</strong> Beyond the sticker discount, you can earn additional savings through cashback credit cards, shopping portals, and rebate apps. A 2% cashback credit card effectively adds another 2% to any discount you receive. Apps like Rakuten, Ibotta, and Honey offer additional cashback that stacks with existing sales and coupons.</p>
    <p><strong>Watch for price adjustments.</strong> Many retailers offer price adjustment policies that refund you the difference if an item you recently purchased goes on sale within a set window, typically 7 to 14 days. If you buy a $200 item and it drops to $150 the following week, you can often request a $50 credit. Keep your receipts and monitor prices on recent purchases during major sale events.</p>
    <p><strong>Beware of inflated "original" prices.</strong> Some retailers artificially inflate the original price to make the discount appear larger than it really is. A product listed as "$200, now 50% off at $100" might have a market value closer to $100 to begin with. Research the item's typical selling price across multiple retailers before assuming you are getting a great deal. Price-tracking tools and browser extensions can show you an item's price history.</p>
    <p><strong>Calculate cost per unit for bulk deals.</strong> When evaluating quantity discounts or larger package sizes, always calculate the price per unit, per ounce, or per serving to determine true value. A larger package is not always cheaper per unit. Sometimes a smaller size on sale offers a lower per-unit cost than the bulk option at its regular price.</p>

    <h2>Discount vs Markup</h2>
    <p>While discounts reduce the selling price below the listed amount, markups increase the cost price to establish the selling price. Understanding both concepts gives you a fuller picture of how pricing works in retail and can make you a more informed consumer and negotiator.</p>
    <p>A markup is the amount added to the cost of a product to determine its selling price. If a retailer buys a product wholesale for $40 and sells it for $100, the markup is $60, or 150% of the cost. Markup percentage is always calculated based on the cost price, not the selling price. The formula is: Markup % = ((Selling Price &minus; Cost Price) / Cost Price) &times; 100.</p>
    <p>A discount, by contrast, is always calculated based on the selling price. If that same $100 product goes on sale for 30% off, the discount amount is $30 and the sale price is $70. Even at 30% off, the retailer still makes $30 in gross profit on the item (sale price of $70 minus the $40 cost). This is why retailers can offer significant discounts and still remain profitable.</p>
    <p>The relationship between margin, markup, and discount is important for understanding retail economics. Gross margin is the percentage of the selling price that is profit: ($100 &minus; $40) / $100 = 60% margin. A product with a 60% margin can be discounted up to 60% before the retailer begins losing money on each sale. In practice, retailers factor in overhead costs like rent, labor, and marketing, so the break-even discount is lower than the gross margin.</p>
    <p>For consumers, understanding markup helps put discounts in perspective. A 50% off sale on a product with a 70% margin still generates profit for the retailer. This does not diminish the value of the discount to you as a buyer; you are genuinely paying less. But it does explain why "going out of business" sales can offer 60% to 80% off and still allow the business to recoup costs. It also explains why certain product categories, like designer fashion and electronics accessories, frequently appear on deep discount while others, like groceries and commodity goods with thin margins, rarely do.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3>How do you calculate a discount on a price?</h3>
    <p>To calculate a discount, multiply the original price by the discount percentage as a decimal. For example, to find 20% off a $100 item, multiply $100 by 0.20 to get a $20 discount. Then subtract the discount from the original price: $100 &minus; $20 = $80 sale price. You can also calculate the sale price directly by multiplying the original price by (1 minus the discount rate): $100 &times; 0.80 = $80. This approach is especially useful for mental math when you want a quick estimate of the final price.</p>

    <h3>How do stacked discounts work?</h3>
    <p>Stacked discounts are applied one after another, not added together. If a $100 item has 20% off and then an additional 10% off, the first discount brings the price to $80, and the second discount takes 10% off that $80, resulting in a $72 final price. This is a total savings of $28, or 28% off, not 30% as you might initially expect. The more discounts you stack, the greater the gap between the sum of the individual percentages and the actual total discount. Mathematically, stacked discounts of D1 and D2 produce a combined rate of 1 &minus; (1 &minus; D1) &times; (1 &minus; D2).</p>

    <h3>Should sales tax be calculated before or after a discount?</h3>
    <p>Sales tax is always calculated after the discount has been applied. In every U.S. state that charges sales tax, the taxable amount is the actual price paid by the consumer, which is the discounted price. If an item is originally $100 and discounted to $75, you pay sales tax on $75, not $100. This means a discount saves you money on both the item itself and the tax you owe, making the total savings slightly larger than the discount alone. For example, with an 8% tax rate, you save $25 on the item plus $2.00 in reduced tax, for total savings of $27.</p>
