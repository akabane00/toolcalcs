    <h2>What Is Compound Interest?</h2>
    <p>Compound interest is often called the "eighth wonder of the world." Unlike simple interest, which is calculated only on your original deposit, compound interest is calculated on your initial principal <strong>plus</strong> all the interest that has accumulated over time.</p>
    <p>This means your money earns interest on interest, creating a snowball effect that accelerates your wealth growth over the years. The longer your money compounds, the more powerful the effect becomes.</p>

    <h2>The Compound Interest Formula</h2>
    <p>The standard compound interest formula is:</p>
    <div class="formula-box">
      <code>A = P(1 + r/n)<sup>nt</sup></code>
    </div>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>A</strong> = Final amount (principal + interest)</li>
      <li><strong>P</strong> = Principal (initial investment)</li>
      <li><strong>r</strong> = Annual interest rate (as a decimal)</li>
      <li><strong>n</strong> = Number of times interest compounds per year</li>
      <li><strong>t</strong> = Number of years</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Compounding Frequency Affects Your Returns</h2>
    <p>The more frequently interest compounds, the more you earn. Here is how different frequencies compare for a $10,000 investment at 7% annual interest over 10 years:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Annually:</strong> $19,671.51</li>
      <li><strong>Quarterly:</strong> $19,897.89</li>
      <li><strong>Monthly:</strong> $19,967.16</li>
      <li><strong>Daily:</strong> $20,137.53</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While the difference may seem small, it becomes significant with larger amounts and longer time periods.</p>

    <h2>Tips to Maximize Compound Interest</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Start early.</strong> The earlier you begin investing, the more time compound interest has to work.</li>
      <li><strong>Contribute regularly.</strong> Even small monthly contributions add up significantly over decades.</li>
      <li><strong>Reinvest dividends.</strong> Automatically reinvesting dividends compounds your returns further.</li>
      <li><strong>Minimize fees.</strong> High fees eat into your compounding returns over time.</li>
      <li><strong>Be patient.</strong> Compounding is most powerful over long periods—think decades, not months.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Compound Interest vs. Simple Interest</h2>
    <p>With <strong>simple interest</strong>, you earn interest only on the original principal. For example, $10,000 at 7% simple interest earns $700 per year, every year—always $700.</p>
    <p>With <strong>compound interest</strong>, you earn interest on your principal plus accumulated interest. In year one, you earn $700. In year two, you earn $749 (7% of $10,700). Each year, the interest amount grows.</p>
    <p>After 20 years, $10,000 at 7% becomes $24,000 with simple interest but <strong>$38,697</strong> with compound interest—a difference of over $14,000.</p>

    <h2>The Rule of 72</h2>
    <p>The Rule of 72 is a quick mental math shortcut to estimate how long it takes for an investment to double. Simply divide 72 by the annual interest rate, and the result is the approximate number of years to double your money.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>At <strong>7%</strong> return: 72 / 7 = <strong>10.3 years</strong> to double</li>
      <li>At <strong>10%</strong> return: 72 / 10 = <strong>7.2 years</strong> to double</li>
      <li>At <strong>3%</strong> return: 72 / 3 = <strong>24 years</strong> to double</li>
      <li>At <strong>12%</strong> return: 72 / 12 = <strong>6 years</strong> to double</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This rule is derived from the natural logarithm formula ln(2)/ln(1+r), and it works best for interest rates between 2% and 15%. For instance, a high-yield savings account at 4.5% would double your balance in approximately 16 years (72/4.5), while a diversified stock fund averaging 9% would double your investment in about 8 years (72/9).</p>
    <p>The Rule of 72 also works in reverse. If prices are rising at 6% inflation per year, your purchasing power will be cut in half in approximately 12 years (72/6). This makes it a powerful tool for understanding both investment growth and the erosion of money over time.</p>

    <h2>Real-World Compound Interest Examples</h2>
    <p>Seeing compound interest in action with realistic scenarios helps illustrate just how powerful—or dangerous—it can be.</p>
    <h3>Starting Early: Investing at 25 vs. 35</h3>
    <p><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> A 25-year-old invests $200 per month at a 7% average annual return until age 65. After 40 years, the account grows to approximately <strong>$528,000</strong>—even though only $96,000 was contributed out of pocket. The remaining $432,000 came entirely from compound interest.</p>
    <p><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> The same person waits until age 35 to start investing the same $200 per month at 7%. After 30 years, the account reaches approximately <strong>$243,000</strong>—less than half of the first scenario. The total contributions were $72,000, and interest added $171,000. Waiting just 10 years cost over $285,000 in lost growth.</p>
    <h3>When Compound Interest Works Against You</h3>
    <p><strong>Scenario 3:</strong> Consider a $5,000 credit card balance at 22% APR. If you make only minimum payments (typically 2% of the balance or $25, whichever is greater), it would take over <strong>20 years</strong> to pay off the balance, and you would pay more than <strong>$10,000 in interest</strong>—over twice the original purchase. This is compound interest working against the borrower, as interest accrues on unpaid interest each month.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3>What is a good compound interest rate?</h3>
    <p>Historically, the U.S. stock market has returned an average of about 10% per year before inflation (about 7% after inflation). High-yield savings accounts typically offer 4-5% APY, while CDs may offer 3-5% depending on the term.</p>

    <h3>How often should interest be compounded?</h3>
    <p>More frequent compounding is better for the investor. Most savings accounts compound daily, while many investment accounts compound based on dividend payment schedules (often quarterly). The difference between daily and monthly compounding is usually minimal.</p>

    <h3>Can compound interest work against you?</h3>
    <p>Yes. When you borrow money (credit cards, loans), compound interest works against you. Credit card debt, which often compounds daily at rates of 15-25%, can grow rapidly if only minimum payments are made.</p>

    <h3>How much will $10,000 grow in 10 years?</h3>
    <p>It depends on the interest rate and compounding frequency. With monthly compounding, $10,000 would grow to approximately <strong>$16,470 at 5%</strong>, <strong>$20,097 at 7%</strong>, or <strong>$27,070 at 10%</strong> over 10 years. The higher the rate and the more frequently interest compounds, the more your money grows.</p>

    <h3>Is compound interest the same as APY?</h3>
    <p>Not exactly, but they are closely related. APY (Annual Percentage Yield) is the effective annual rate that accounts for compounding. A nominal interest rate of 5% compounded monthly results in an APY of approximately 5.12%. When comparing savings accounts or CDs, always compare APY rather than the nominal rate, as APY reflects the true return including the compounding effect.</p>
