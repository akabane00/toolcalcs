    <h2>How to Calculate Crypto Profit</h2>
    <p>
      Calculating cryptocurrency profit is straightforward: subtract your total cost (including fees) from your total proceeds (after fees). The key formula is:
    </p>
    <div class="formula-box">
      <code>Profit = (Sell Price × Quantity × (1 - Sell Fee%)) - (Buy Price × Quantity × (1 + Buy Fee%))</code>
    </div>
    <p>
      For example, if you bought 0.5 Bitcoin at $40,000 per coin with a 0.5% fee, your total investment is $40,000 × 0.5 × 1.005 = $20,100. If you sell at $65,000 per coin with a 0.5% fee, your exit value is $65,000 × 0.5 × 0.995 = $32,337.50. Your profit is $32,337.50 - $20,100 = $12,237.50.
    </p>

    <h2>Understanding ROI in Crypto</h2>
    <p>
      Return on Investment (ROI) measures the percentage gain or loss relative to your initial investment. An ROI of 100% means you doubled your money. Cryptocurrency markets can produce both extreme gains and devastating losses, making it essential to understand your actual ROI including all trading fees.
    </p>
    <div class="formula-box">
      <code>ROI = (Profit / Total Investment) × 100</code>
    </div>
    <p>
      Keep in mind that ROI does not account for the time period of your investment. A 50% return over five years is very different from a 50% return in one month. For time-adjusted returns, consider the annualized return.
    </p>

    <h2>Trading Fees and Their Impact</h2>
    <p>
      Crypto trading fees can significantly eat into your profits, especially for frequent traders. Major exchanges charge between 0.1% and 1.5% per trade. For a $20,000 investment, a 0.5% fee on both buy and sell transactions costs $200 — a 1% drag on returns. Over many trades, these fees compound and can substantially reduce your overall profitability.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to exchange trading fees, you may incur blockchain network fees (gas fees) for transfers, withdrawal fees for moving crypto to external wallets, and spread costs (the difference between buy and sell prices on the exchange).
    </p>

    <h2>Crypto Tax Implications</h2>
    <p>
      In the United States, the IRS treats cryptocurrency as property. Every sale, trade, or exchange of crypto is a taxable event. Short-term capital gains (assets held less than one year) are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate. Long-term capital gains (held over one year) are taxed at preferential rates of 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on your total taxable income.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to keep detailed records of every transaction, including the date, amount, price, and fees. Many investors use crypto tax software to track their cost basis and generate tax reports. Consult a tax professional for personalized guidance.
    </p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>How do I calculate crypto profit?</h3>
    <p>
      Crypto profit equals the sell proceeds minus the total investment, including all fees. The formula is: Profit = (Sell Price × Quantity - Sell Fees) - (Buy Price × Quantity + Buy Fees). Use this calculator to account for percentage-based exchange fees automatically.
    </p>

    <h3>Do I have to pay taxes on crypto profits?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, in the U.S., crypto profits are taxable. Short-term gains (held under 1 year) are taxed as ordinary income. Long-term gains (held over 1 year) are taxed at 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on your income level. Even swapping one crypto for another is a taxable event.
    </p>

    <h3>What fees are involved in crypto trading?</h3>
    <p>
      Common fees include exchange trading fees (typically 0.1-1.5% per trade), blockchain network/gas fees, withdrawal fees, and the bid-ask spread. Fee structures vary by exchange — some offer discounts for high volume or for using the exchange's native token.
