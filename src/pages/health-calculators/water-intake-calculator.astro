    <h2>How Much Water Should I Drink?</h2>
    <p>
      Water is essential for virtually every bodily function — from regulating body temperature and transporting nutrients to cushioning joints and removing waste. While the old "8 glasses a day" rule is a reasonable starting point, your actual water needs depend on your body size, physical activity, climate, and overall health.
    </p>
    <p>
      A widely used guideline is to drink half your body weight in ounces. A 160-pound person would aim for 80 ounces (about 2.4 liters) per day. This calculator refines that baseline by adjusting for your activity level and climate, which can significantly increase your fluid needs.
    </p>

    <h2>How This Calculator Works</h2>
    <p>
      The calculator starts with the baseline formula of body weight (lbs) ÷ 2 = ounces per day. It then applies multipliers based on your activity level and climate:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sedentary:</strong> Baseline (×1.0)</li>
      <li><strong>Light exercise:</strong> Baseline × 1.1</li>
      <li><strong>Moderate exercise:</strong> Baseline × 1.2</li>
      <li><strong>Active:</strong> Baseline × 1.4</li>
      <li><strong>Very Active:</strong> Baseline × 1.6</li>
      <li><strong>Hot climate:</strong> Additional × 1.2</li>
      <li><strong>Cold climate:</strong> Additional × 1.05 (cold air is drier)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Signs of Dehydration</h2>
    <p>
      Even mild dehydration can affect your physical and mental performance. Common signs include dark yellow urine, thirst, dry mouth, fatigue, headache, dizziness, and decreased urine output. The simplest way to monitor hydration is urine color — aim for pale straw yellow. Clear urine may indicate overhydration, while dark amber suggests you need more water.
    </p>

    <h2>Tips for Staying Hydrated</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Carry a reusable water bottle and sip throughout the day rather than drinking large amounts at once.</li>
      <li>Drink a glass of water when you wake up to rehydrate after sleep.</li>
      <li>Set reminders on your phone if you frequently forget to drink water.</li>
      <li>Eat water-rich foods like cucumbers, watermelon, oranges, and soups.</li>
      <li>Drink extra water before, during, and after exercise — about 16-24 oz per hour of moderate exercise.</li>
      <li>If plain water is boring, try infusing it with lemon, cucumber, mint, or berries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>How much water should I drink a day?</h3>
    <p>
      A general guideline is half your body weight (in pounds) in ounces per day. The U.S. National Academies recommend about 125 oz (3.7L) for men and 91 oz (2.7L) for women from all sources including food. Active individuals and those in hot climates need more.
    </p>

    <h3>Does coffee count as water intake?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, coffee and tea contribute to your daily fluid intake. While caffeine has a mild diuretic effect, the net hydration from these beverages is still positive. However, pure water remains the best hydration choice.
    </p>

    <h3>Can you drink too much water?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, overhydration (hyponatremia) is possible but rare. It can occur when excessive water intake dilutes blood sodium to dangerous levels. For most people, drinking when thirsty and keeping urine pale yellow is a safe and effective hydration strategy.
